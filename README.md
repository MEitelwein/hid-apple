# hid-apple
Patches to linux hid-apple for new Apple Magic Keyboard 2015 (USB ID 05AC:0267). I have a german keyboard layout.

Patch is based on kernel 4.2.0-34.39 of ubuntu

To patch your own kernel modules, see instructions at http://askubuntu.com/questions/515407/how-recipe-to-build-only-one-kernel-module

Works perfectly as lon the keyboard is attached by USB. Have not found out yet how to patch to use keyboard via bluetooth.
