# hid-apple
Patches to linux hid-apple for new Apple Magic Keyboard 2015 (USB ID 05AC:0267). This is a very 
thin aluminium keyboard which can be attached via bluetooth or usb. I am using a german keyboard
layout which works well with the ISO settings in hid-apple.

Patch is based on kernel 4.2.0-34.39 of ubuntu.

To patch your own kernel modules, see instructions at http://askubuntu.com/questions/515407/how-recipe-to-build-only-one-kernel-module

Works perfectly as long the keyboard is attached by USB. Have not found out yet how to patch to use keyboard via bluetooth.
